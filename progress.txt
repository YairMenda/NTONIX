## Iteration 1 - US-001: Project Foundation and Build System
- What was implemented:
  - CMakeLists.txt with C++20 standard, Boost.Asio/Beast, OpenSSL, nlohmann_json, spdlog, xxHash
  - CMakePresets.json for modern CMake workflow (debug, release, vcpkg variants)
  - vcpkg.json manifest for easy dependency installation
  - Project directory structure per PRD specification
  - Minimal main.cpp that verifies all dependencies compile
  - .gitignore for build artifacts

- Files changed:
  - CMakeLists.txt (new)
  - CMakePresets.json (new)
  - vcpkg.json (new)
  - .gitignore (new)
  - src/main.cpp (new)
  - Created directories: src/{server,proxy,balancer,cache,config,util}, tests/integration, mock, docs, config

- Learnings for future iterations:
  - Development environment may not have CMake/Boost/OpenSSL installed - use Docker for reliable builds
  - FetchContent is used as fallback for nlohmann_json, spdlog, xxHash when not found via find_package
  - vcpkg preset requires VCPKG_ROOT environment variable to be set
  - Windows builds need _WIN32_WINNT=0x0A00 for Boost.Asio
  - C++20 features like std::jthread require compiler support (GCC 10+, Clang 11+, MSVC 19.28+)

## Iteration 2 - US-002: Asynchronous I/O Foundation
- What was implemented:
  - Server class with io_context and configurable thread pool (uses hardware_concurrency by default)
  - Graceful shutdown using std::jthread with stop_token coordination
  - Signal handling for SIGINT, SIGTERM (and SIGHUP on non-Windows)
  - TCP acceptor on configurable port with async_accept loop
  - Connection handler callback pattern for extensibility
  - Work guard to keep io_context alive until explicit shutdown
  - Dockerfile.build for Docker-based compilation and testing

- Files changed:
  - src/server/server.hpp (new) - Server class declaration with ServerConfig struct
  - src/server/server.cpp (new) - Full implementation of async server
  - src/main.cpp (modified) - Updated to use new Server class with simple HTTP response handler
  - CMakeLists.txt (modified) - Added server.cpp to sources, relaxed Boost version to 1.74+
  - Dockerfile.build (new) - Docker build environment for compilation

- Learnings for future iterations:
  - Ubuntu 22.04 ships with Boost 1.74, not 1.83 - relaxed version requirement
  - xxHash FetchContent requires SOURCE_SUBDIR cmake_unofficial to find CMakeLists.txt
  - Docker is reliable for testing when dev environment lacks CMake/Boost
  - std::jthread automatically joins on destruction, simplifying shutdown
  - work_guard is essential to prevent io_context from exiting when no work pending
  - Use boost::system::error_code for non-throwing error handling in async callbacks
  - Signal handling works cross-platform with Boost.Asio signal_set
