## Iteration 1 - US-011: SSL/TLS Termination

### What was implemented
SSL/TLS termination was already fully implemented in the codebase:

1. **Certificate Loading**: `SslContextManager` class in `ssl_context.cpp` loads PEM certificates and private keys with password support
2. **HTTPS Acceptor**: `SslServer` class accepts connections on configured SSL port and initiates TLS handshake
3. **TLS 1.2/1.3**: Configured via OpenSSL with `SSL_CTX_set_min_proto_version()` and secure cipher suites
4. **Request Forwarding**: `main.cpp` uses the same request handlers for both HTTP and HTTPS connections
5. **Handshake Handling**: `SslConnection::on_handshake()` gracefully handles SSL errors, timeouts, and truncated streams
6. **SNI Support**: `ssl_sni_callback()` enables Server Name Indication for multiple hostnames

### Files involved
- `src/server/ssl_context.hpp/cpp` - SSL context management and certificate loading
- `src/server/ssl_server.hpp/cpp` - HTTPS acceptor implementation
- `src/server/ssl_connection.hpp/cpp` - SSL connection handler
- `src/main.cpp` - Integration of SSL server with main application
- `CMakeLists.txt` - SSL source files already included in build

### Learnings for future iterations
- SSL implementation uses boost::asio::ssl with OpenSSL backend
- SslContextManager supports multiple contexts for SNI-based virtual hosting
- SSL streaming not yet implemented (ssl_streaming_handler is null in main.cpp)
- Build verification requires cmake and compiler - not available in this environment
- The ssl_context uses tlsv12 as base but configures actual versions via SSL_CTX_set_min/max_proto_version
